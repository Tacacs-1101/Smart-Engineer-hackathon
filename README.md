# Smart-Engineer-hackathon

## Introducton
This online competition was organised by hackerearth. It contains a regression problem. There are four predictor variables which are all numeric and we have to predict the target variable. The dataset can be downloaded from the repository.

## Section
1. Exploratory analysis.
2. Feature engineering.
3. Modelling.
    1. Polynomial regression
    2. Ridge regression


## Evaluation
The evaluation metric considered is rmse( root mean squared error ). r_squared coefficient are also calculated but the parameters are tuned based on the rmse score.
